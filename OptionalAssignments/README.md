Catchup Assignment 1 

Sequential model:
A Sequential model is appropriate for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.

ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors) is a method for efficient vector similarity search at scale. which includes search space pruning and 
quantization for Maximum Inner Product Search and also supports other distance functions such as Euclidean distance. The implementation 
is designed for x86 processors with AVX2 support. ScaNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on ann-benchmarks.com. scalable deep retrieval
is acheived by using ScaNN

Embeddings were created using multiple layers in the model
